# DSP439 Final
This repository contains the implementation of a Python script designed to analyze DNA sequences by identifying all substrings (k-mers) of a given length and their subsequent substrings. It includes functions to read sequences from a file, find k-mers, aggregate k-mers across multiple sequences, and determine the smallest k where each k-mer is followed by exactly one subsequent k-mer.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
Pytest, Python 3.0+

### Installation
`git clone https://github.com/emorysalaun/DSP439Final.git`
`cd DSP439Final`

### Running the script
To run the script, you will need a .txt file containing DNA sequences, one sequence per line.
`python Exam.py sequences.txt`

### Running the tests
Tests are included under the tests.py file, to run them use `pytest tests.py`
